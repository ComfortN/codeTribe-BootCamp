## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- JavaScript



### What I learned

 I learned how to structure a web page using HTML, including defining the layout, organizing content, and integrating external resources like images and icons. How to style the web page to achieve a visually appealing layout. This includes applying colors, fonts, spacing, and alignment to various elements, as well as creating responsive designs that adapt to different screen sizes. I learned how to enhance the interactivity of the web page using JavaScript variables and functions.

 Through the process of building this project, I gained experience in project planning, organization, and execution. This included setting project goals, breaking down tasks, managing resources, and troubleshooting issues along the way.

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```html
<h1>Some HTML code I'm proud of</h1>
```
```css
.proud-of-this-css {
  color: papayawhip;
}
```
```js
const proudOfThisFunc = () => {
  console.log('ðŸŽ‰')
}
```


### Continued development

In future projects, I aim to continue refining my skills and expanding my knowledge in JavaScript while I've made progress in using JavaScript for this project, I recognize the need to deepen my understanding and proficiency in this language. I plan to dedicate more time to learning advanced JavaScript concepts and practicing coding techniques to become more confident in using it for complex functionalities.
And also enhance my skills in creating responsive layouts that seamlessly adapt to various screen sizes and devices. This includes mastering media queries, exploring flexible grids, and optimizing images for different resolutions to ensure a consistent and optimal user experience across all platforms.
